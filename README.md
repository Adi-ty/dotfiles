The Neovim configuration files can be found in the `.config/nvim` directory. Lazyvim is used as the base configuration, and my own customizations are added on top of it.

## Tmux Config

The Tmux configuration file can be found in the `.tmux.conf`. This file contains my customized Tmux settings, keybindings, and status bar configurations.

## Zshrc Oh My Zsh Config

The Zsh configuration file for Oh My Zsh can be found in the `.zshrc` file. This file includes my preferred Zsh settings, aliases, and Oh My Zsh theme configurations.
